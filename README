SpeedTouch WEP key finder
===================================

This program computes the default factory WEP key of a SpeedTouch modem based
on the key displayed in the SSID.

Building
========

This project uses autoconf & friends as its build toolchain. Building it should
be trivial once the GNU autoconf toolchain is installed.

In Debian based systems the build dependencies can be easily installed by
doing:

	sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf libtool


If you have forked the code from github you will need to run the autoconf
programs in order to prepare build toolchain:

	autoreconf -vif

Once the toolchain scripts are created simply build the program with:

	./configure --prefix=/usr && make && sudo make install

You should now be able to execute the program speedkey!


Usage
=====

The progam is started from the command line and takes its parameters from the
command line. It expects to receive as input the random part of the SSID that
each SpeedTouch modem has as it's factory default. For instance, if your modem
identifies itselft as "SpeedTouchAABBCC" then simply provide the parameter
"AABBCC" as input.

	speedkey ABBA11

The program can output multiple WEP keys, this is normal as the other serial
numbers can endup generating the same SSID value. There's nothing that can be
done to prevent this. Rest assured that one of the keys printed is the one
defined as the factory key.

Option -d outputs the SSID/key in Debian's ifupdown /etc/network/interfaces
format, for ease of pasting.
